# Firebase Studio

This is a Next.js starter project built in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at the code in `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Exporting and Running Locally

To download a complete copy of your project code and run it on your own computer, follow these steps:

### 1. Export Your Project

Look for an **Export** or **Download Code** button within the Firebase Studio interface. It is typically located in one of these places:

- In a **File** or **Project** menu in the top menu bar.
- Inside a **three-dot menu (⋮)** or a **gear icon (⚙️)** near the project name.
- In the **command palette** (usually opened with `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`), where you can search for "Export".

This will download a `.zip` file containing all your project files.

### 2. Unzip the File

Extract the contents of the downloaded `.zip` file to a folder on your computer.

### 3. Run Locally

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate into the project folder you just created, and run the following commands:

```bash
# Install all the necessary dependencies
npm install

# Start the local development server
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running locally, and you can open it in your web browser at the address provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:9002`).
